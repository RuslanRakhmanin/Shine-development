# Shine Development

## Description

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of a version control system (Git) in a software development workflow.

As an example, the task for this project was to recreate a version of Shine, a painting by Wassily Kandinsky, in SVG format. While the output may not perfectly replicate the original, it captures the essence and spirit of the artwork (not it does not).
